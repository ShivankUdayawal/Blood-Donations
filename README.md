## Forecasting Blood supply is a serious and recurrent problem for Blood collection managers.
In this Project, I worked with data collected from the donor database of Blood Transfusion Service Centre.  The dataset, obtained from the Machine Learning Repository, consists of a random sample of 748 donors. The task will be to predict if a blood donor will donate within a given time window. Look at the full model-building process: from inspecting the dataset to using the tpot library to automate your Machine Learning pipeline.
